#Capstone Project - The neighborhood battle

This file aims to explain about the Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods.

If you wanted to open a restaurant in Toronto or anywhere else in the world, what would be the best neighborhood to open this type of business? With that in mind, I developed an analysis using the city of Toronto as an example and so that same analysis could be replicated to other cities as desired.
In this project, I will use the Toronto city zip code extracted from the wikipedia website "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M" to map all neighborhoods in the city. We will also use Foursquare connected to this database to help us understand what would be the best region to set up this business.

This project is part of one of the exercises in the Capstone Course in Applied Data Science (Week 4).
