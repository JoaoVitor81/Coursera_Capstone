If you wanted to open a restaurant in Toronto or anywhere else in the world, what would be the best neighborhood to open this type of business? With that in mind, I developed an analysis using the city of Toronto as an example and this way it could be replicated for other cities.
In this project, I will use the Toronto city zip code extracted from the wikipedia website "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M" to map all regions of the city. We will also use Foursquare connected to this database to help us understand what would be the best region to set up this business.
