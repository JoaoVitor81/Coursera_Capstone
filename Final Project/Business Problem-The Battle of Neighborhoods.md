#Capstone Project - The neighborhood battle

This file aims to explain about the Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods.

If you wanted to open your own restaurant, what would be the best neighborhood to set up this business? Where is the greatest demand? With that in mind, I developed an analysis using the city of Toronto as an example. I'm going to connect Foursquare information to our Toronto database and find some insghts that would help us solve this problem.

Note: It is important to note that for this analysis I am only using information from Foursquare, but for a more detailed and faithful analysis we could use other sources of data, such as: population income, sex, age group and others.

This project is part of one of the exercises in the Capstone Course in Applied Data Science (Week 4).
