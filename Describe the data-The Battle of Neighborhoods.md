#Capstone Project - The neighborhood battle

This file aims to explain about the datas that I use for the Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods.

For this project I will use the Toronto city zip code extracted from Wikipedia through the link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M" which contains: Postal Code, Borough, Neighborhood. That way I can cross this data with some information from foursquare to help us with decision making.

This project is part of one of the exercises in the Capstone Course in Applied Data Science (Week 4).
